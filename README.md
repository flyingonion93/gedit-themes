gedit-themes
============

Color themes for Gnome's default editor Gedit.

## How to install them
You can install one theme by importing it in `Preferences` or you can copy each file into `styles` folder, usually located on `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/`. When I say *usually* I mean on my system (Ubuntu 14.04).
I checked that location using the command `locate oblivion.xml`, which is a default theme in Gedit. It may not work properly.
