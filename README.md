gedit-themes and languages
============

Color themes for Gnome's default editor Gedit. I also added new languages.

## How to install themes
You can install one theme by importing it in `Preferences` or you can copy each file into `styles` folder, usually located on `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/`.

## How to install languages
You can install them by copying it to `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs`.

## Installing on Windows
Folders are in **Program Files(x86)** and `\share\gtksourceview-2.0\language-specs`.
