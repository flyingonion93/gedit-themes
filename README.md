# gedit-themes and languages
Color themes for Gnome's default editor Gedit. I also added new languages.

## Installation
### How to install themes
You can install one theme by importing it in `Preferences` or you can copy each file into `styles` folder, usually located on `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/`.

### How to install languages
You can install them by copying it to `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs`.

### How to install snippets
[How-to](snippets/README.md)

### Installing on Windows
Folders are in **Program Files(x86)** and `\share\gtksourceview-2.0\`.

## Contributing
Feel free to push new themes, languages or even snippets.
